## Additional Note


This code utilizes BeautifulSoup and pandas to scrape and extract team information, particularly focusing on Oversea Players, from the IPL auction website. It assumes a specific HTML structure and provides a flexible approach for data extraction. However, it's essential to periodically review and adjust the code to accommodate any changes in the website's structure or content.
